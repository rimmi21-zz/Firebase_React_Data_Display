# Firebase_React_Data_Display
A very basic react app to demonstrate the data coming up from firebase database.

For this React App, i have hooked up data from firebase by creating a dummy db with the list of `Countries` and their `Best_Place` and `Food`. Later i added the required firebase configurations into my react app, installed and setup firebase, and finally pulled up all the data from the firebase database by state management in React.
